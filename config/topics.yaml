    difficulty: beginner
    questions_per_batch: 10
    context: |
      Focus on everyday vocabulary and common expressions for beginner learners.

      Vocabulary level guidance:
        Generate beginner (A1-A2 level) vocabulary with these characteristics:
        - Common everyday words and basic expressions
        - Essential vocabulary for daily survival situations
        - Simple, concrete words (not abstract concepts)
        - High-frequency words that beginners encounter immediately
        - Basic verbs, nouns, and common phrases
        - Fundamental grammar structures

        Draw from these semantic categories:
        - Food and meals: basic foods, drinks, ordering, cooking basics
        - Transportation: vehicles, travel, directions, getting around
        - Shopping: buying, paying, basic commerce vocabulary
        - Directions and locations: asking for and giving directions, places
        - Time expressions: days, hours, when/what time, schedules
        - Greetings and politeness: hello, goodbye, please, thank you
        - Numbers and quantities: counting, prices, amounts
        - Family and people: basic relationships and descriptions
        - Daily routines: common activities, basic verbs of action

        QUALITY CALIBRATION (do not reuse these specific words - they are for complexity reference only):
        ✓ Good complexity: étterem (restaurant - common, practical, A2 level)
        ✓ Good complexity: mennyibe kerül (how much does it cost - essential phrase)
        ✓ Good complexity: busszal utazni (to travel by bus - practical, beginner-appropriate)
        ✗ Too advanced: elkötelezett (committed - abstract, C1-C2 level, too difficult)
        ✗ Too advanced: időpontot kérni (request appointment - intermediate B1-B2)

        Generate NEW vocabulary at the "Good complexity" level (A1-A2), avoiding intermediate and advanced terms.
        Do not reuse the calibration examples above - create fresh questions with different vocabulary.

        Emphasize Magyar-specific grammar quirks and cognates from Finno-Ugric roots where appropriate.

        - Adverbs: manner and degree (essentially, fundamentally, thoroughly)
        - Idiomatic expressions: figurative language about confidence/doubt, non-literal constructions, culturally-specific phrases

        QUALITY CALIBRATION (do not reuse these specific words - they are for complexity reference only):
        ✓ Good complexity: elkötelezett (committed/dedicated - nuanced, contextual, C1-C2 level)
        ✓ Good complexity: kifinomult (sophisticated/refined - abstract quality, multiple meanings)
        ✓ Good complexity: kétségbe vonni (to call into question - idiomatic, non-literal)
